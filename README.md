# AI Cooking Assistant: Recipe Agent using LangGraph & Gemini

This project is an intelligent cooking assistant that helps users decide what to cook based on available ingredients, guides them through recipes, and suggests food or drink pairings. Built using LangGraph, Google Gemini 1.5 Pro, and LangChain memory, this assistant interacts conversationally and retains context for follow-up queries.
